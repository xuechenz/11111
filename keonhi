SPXFP Methodology Summary

Hi [Mentor’s Name],

I’ve put together a summary of the SPXFP methodology, covering the official calculation approach, the quarterly roll mechanism, and how contango/backwardation impacts the excess return. I also added a short FAQ section to address the key questions we discussed.

Please see the attached PDF. Let me know if you’d like me to look further into any part or add more details.

Best,
Annie
