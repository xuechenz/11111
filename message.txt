Hi Eugine,

I’m sending you three files:
Spot.py – pulls the past 5 years of intraday spot data from the TD database.
Xbbg.py – fetches TD tickers from Bloomberg where the intraday change exceeds 10%.
Pipeline – based on TED_Spot.py.
At the moment, I can’t run TED_Spot.py — it returns a “server connection refused” error. Could this be due to incorrect credentials? If so, could you advise how I can check or update them?

Thanks,
Annie
