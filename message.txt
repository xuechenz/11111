I've completed building the XBBG comparison pipeline. Once I’m able to connect to our server for spot data, I’ll start generating the comparisons for the tickers you shared.
To optimize API usage, my approach identifies days in the original spot dataset where the intraday move exceeded 10%, and only fetches adjustments from XBBG for those specific days.
