Hey Denny, I’m Annie, the quant intern on the exotic trading desk this summer.

I was wondering if you might have 15–20 min sometime this week for a quick coffee chat. I’m really curious what Sales is like day to day and how you guys work with the exotic desk. Totally flexible on timing!

Hi Vanessa, I’m Annie, the quant intern currently rotating on the exotic trading desk. We’ve seen each other around quite a bit but haven’t really had the chance to properly chat. I’ve been really curious about the day-to-day work on the Sales side, especially how you interact with clients and understand their needs. Would you happen to have 15–20 minutes sometime this week for a quick coffee chat? Happy to work around your schedule!
