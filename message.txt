I noticed you studied IOE at UMich and then financial engineering for your master’s, which is a path I really relate to. I thought it was really interesting that you moved into Trading rather than a pure quant role, and I’d really love to hear the story behind that decision. As someone early in my career, I’ve been exploring different paths and have gotten more curious about trading since being on the floor. Would you be open to a quick 15–20 min coffee chat sometime next week? Totally flexible on timing!
