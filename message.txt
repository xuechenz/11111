Dear [Mentor's Name],

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to give you a quick update on my recent progress with the GED Manager.

I've modified part of the UI components and successfully reintegrated my summary table back into the main GED Manager interface. The updated version is currently running at:
https://dashboard.td.com/dash/GEDManager-New/

Right now, I'm focusing on debugging the application. So far, I’ve noticed several issues:

Some tickers appear in the dropdown menu but do not actually exist in the database, resulting in missing data.

Certain features are not functioning properly on weekends.

A few code sections contain errors that are preventing correct execution.

I plan to fix these issues over the next few days. Please let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like me to prioritize or if you have any feedback.
Please feel free to test out the updated GED Manager at your convenience and let me know if everything works on your end.

Best regards,
Annie
