Subject: Annie’s GED Presentation – Wednesday at 2:30 PM

Hi everyone,

I’ll be giving a short presentation this Wednesday at 2:30 PM to wrap up my summer rotation with the GED team — would love for you to join if you’re available!

Time: Wednesday, August 7th, 2:30–3:00 PM
Location: [e.g. 1V – Room 23A / Teams link]
Topic: GED Summer Highlights – Tools, Research & Takeaways

I’ll be walking through some of the work I’ve done this summer — including updates to the GED Manager dashboard and Vega map tool, research on SPX futures and corporate action-adjusted spot prices, and a few takeaways from learning more about structured notes through conversations on the floor.

Thanks so much for all your support these past few weeks. Looking forward to seeing you there!

Best,
Annie
