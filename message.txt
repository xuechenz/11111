Hi Brad, hope you’re doing well!
I’m Annie, the quant intern currently rotating on the exotic trading desk—and also a fellow Michigan alum, go blue! I noticed you studied IOE at UMich and then financial engineering for your master’s, which is a path I really relate to. But you ended up in trading instead of a pure quant role, which I find really interesting. As someone early in my career, I’ve been exploring different paths and have gotten more curious about trading since being on the floor. Would you be open to a quick 15–20 min coffee chat sometime next week? I’d really love to hear about your experience and how you made that transition. Totally flexible on timing!
