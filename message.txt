Hey Denny, I’m Annie, the quant intern on the exotic trading desk this summer.

I was wondering if you might have 15–20 min sometime this week for a quick coffee chat. I’m really curious what Sales is like day to day and how you guys work with the exotic desk. Totally flexible on timing!

Hi Vanessa, I’m Annie, the quant intern rotating on the exotic desk. I was wondering if you might have 15–20 min this week for a quick coffee chat sometimes this week. I’d love to learn more about the Sales side, especially how you work with clients on structured notes and how you collaborate with traders. I’m happy to adjust to whatever time is convenient for you.
