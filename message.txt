Hi all,

Sharing the slides from my GED presentation yesterday, in case you weren’t able to attend or would like to review the materials.

Today is also my last day — thank you again for the chance to be part of the team this summer. I’ve learned a great deal and truly appreciated the support, guidance, and conversations along the way.

Wishing you all the best going forward.

Best regards,
Annie
