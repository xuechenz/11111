Hi Jasdeep,

Thank you again for the opportunity to work with you and GED this summer.

From our first conversation during the interview, I’ve been grateful for the chance to join TD. Over the past few weeks, I’ve learned a lot—not just about the products and how the desk operates, but also about the value of clear, thoughtful communication. Your advice about stepping out of my comfort zone and engaging more with the floor really stayed with me. Over the past week, I made a conscious effort to connect with as many people as I could, and those conversations gave me a much better understanding of how the team collaborates and operates day to day. It also helped me build more confidence in navigating the desk. On the technical side, I’ve gained a much deeper understanding of structured products, risk, and how the desk thinks about market sensitivities.

I’ve really enjoyed being part of this team. I love the energy and the people here. I’d truly love the chance to return to GED and keep learning and contributing.

Wishing you a great time in Canada next week with your family. Hope it’s a relaxing and well-deserved break.

Best,
Annie
