Subject: Annie’s GED Presentation – Wednesday at 2:30 PM

Hi everyone,

I’m Annie, a quant intern currently rotating with the GED team. I’ll be giving a short presentation this Wednesday at 2:30 PM to wrap up my summer rotation — would love for you to join if you’re available!

Time: Wednesday, August 7th, 2:30–3:00 PM
Location: [e.g. 1V – Room 23A / Teams link]
Topic: GED Summer Highlights – Tools, Research & Takeaways

I’ll be sharing some of my summer projects, including enhancements to the GED Manager dashboard, development of a Vega map tool, and coding work on corporate action-adjusted spot prices in TD’s database.

Thanks so much for all your support these past few weeks. Looking forward to seeing you there!

Best,
Annie
