Hi [Boss’s Name],

Thanks again for the chance to present today — I’ve attached the slides and supporting materials below. Please let me know if there’s anything else I should send over.

I also wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank you for all your support this summer. I’ve learned so much through this rotation, and I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunity to work with you and the QMA team. From the very beginning, I felt welcomed and challenged in the best way — it’s been a truly meaningful experience.

If I’m fortunate enough to return, I would love the chance to come back to QMA and continue growing here.

Hope we can stay in touch!

Best,
Annie
