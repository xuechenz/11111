Hi Chris, I’m Annie, the quant intern currently rotating on the exotic trading desk. I’ve been meaning to properly introduce myself, as we haven’t had the chance to speak one-on-one. I’m from a pure quant background, but I believe to really add value as a quant it’s important to understand the needs of Sales and Trading and see how the whole desk works together. I’d really value the opportunity to hear your views on the current client demand for structured notes and how Sales presents these products to clients. Would you happen to have 15–20 minutes sometime this week for a quick coffee chat? I’m happy to work around your schedule.
