Hi Allison, hope you’re doing well! I’m Annie, the quant intern currently rotating on the exotic trading desk. As someone early in my career, I’ve been really curious about the different paths people take in this industry. Your background really caught my attention—Econ & CS, then starting in Trading and now in Sales. It feels like such an unexpected but really cool path, and I’d love to hear the story behind it. Would you be open to a quick 15–20 min coffee chat sometime next week if that works for you? I’m totally flexible on timing!
