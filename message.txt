Hi Chris, I’m Annie, the quant intern currently rotating on the exotic trading desk. Although we’ve seen each other around, I haven’t had the opportunity to properly connect with you. I’d really value the opportunity to hear your views on the current client demand for structured notes and how Sales presents these products to clients. Would you happen to have 15–20 minutes sometime this week for a quick coffee chat? I’m happy to work around your schedule.
