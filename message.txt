I was looking at the current script, and it seems like it only pulls one price per day. Just wanted to check â€” when you mentioned identifying names that moved more than 10% within the day, were you referring to intraday data (like minute or hourly)?

If so, do we have access to that somewhere? Happy to update the code once I know where to pull it from.
