Hi Zhongguo, apologies for the delay — I didn’t have my resume on this laptop last week, and I also wanted to update it with my latest TD experience before sending. I’ve just emailed you the updated version — please let me know if you have any trouble opening it.

Hi Zhongguo,

Apologies for the delay — I didn’t have my resume on this laptop last week, and I also took the opportunity to update it with my latest TD experience before sending.

Thank you again for taking the time to walk me through the UQL library when we spoke — I really appreciated how patient and detailed you were. I’d love to work with you on it and learn from you if the chance comes up.

Please find my updated resume attached.

Best regards,
Annie Xuechen Zhang
