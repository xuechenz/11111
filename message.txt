Hi Ian,

Thanks for the question – here’s exactly where each data series comes from and how we pull it:

Database & Collection
We use a single MongoDB instance and query the option chain collection via our conn (aka TotemOptionResults) connector.

1. IV Benchmark
TD fitting: pulled from ClientImpliedVolatility (our internal implied-vol fit)
Totem consensus: pulled from ConsensusImpliedVolatility (Totem’s consensus IV)
Pull process:
1.conn queries by Underlying, ValuationDate, OptionType, etc.
2.We extract both fields across all strikes/tenors.
3.Rebuild into a tenor-by-strike matrix and compute TD minus Totem for the heatmap.

2. DIV Benchmark
TD marks: pulled from ClientDividendYield (our internal dividend yield)
Totem consensus: pulled from ConsensusDividendYield (Totem’s consensus yield)
Pull process:
1.Query the same collection via conn.
2.Read both fields for each tenor.
3.Plot TD vs. Totem on the tenor axis and generate the summary table.

3. Repo Benchmark
TD marks: pulled from ClientImpliedForward (our internal implied-forward/repo rate)
Totem consensus: pulled from ConsensusImpliedForward (Totem’s consensus forward rate)
Pull process:
1.Pull records with conn.
2.Extract those two fields by tenor.
3.Annualize each tenor’s rate and chart TD vs. Totem.

Note:
All fields live in the same option chain collection—no external CSVs or other APIs.
If a ticker (e.g. certain CA symbols) or a data field (e.g. dividends) isn’t present, the query returns empty and the UI simply shows “no data.”
Hope this clarifies where each data series comes from. Let me know if you need any more detail!

Best, 
Annie
