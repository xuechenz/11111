Hi Dev,

I hope you’re doing well. As my internship is coming to an end this week, I was wondering if you might have a few minutes for a quick chat.

I’d really like to thank you in person for the opportunity to intern in QMA, and also hear your thoughts on career development as I plan my next steps. It’s been a truly valuable summer, and I’ve learned a lot from being part of the team.

Please let me know if there’s a time that works best for you — I’m happy to work around your schedule.

Best regards,
Annie


Hi Robert, the conversation went really well!
ZY walked me through some of the curve and UQL library work — I didn’t fully get all the implementation details, but I understood the main challenges they’re facing. I also told him I’d love to get involved, and he was very welcoming. He mentioned attitude is the most important, and headcount wouldn’t be a blocker if I were to join in the future
