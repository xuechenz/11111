Final Deliverables – Summer Projects

Hi [Team / All / Robert, Jasdeep, Keonhi], (根据你是否群发决定怎么写称呼)

As today is my last day, I’ve zipped all the materials from my summer projects with GED and attached them here for your reference. The folder includes:

Code and documentation for the Vega Map Generator

GED Manager dashboard updates

Spot price adjustment scripts

Final presentation slides and report

Please let me know if anything is missing or if you have any trouble accessing the files.

Thank you again for the opportunity and all the support this summer — I’ve learned so much and truly enjoyed working with the team.

Best regards,
Annie
