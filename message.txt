Subject: Spot Price Discrepancy Scripts – Corporate Action Adjustments

Hi Eugene,

Hope you’re doing well!

I’ve been working on a small project investigating spot price discrepancies caused by the lack of corporate action adjustments in our internal database. I’ve drafted two scripts for this, but since I don’t have access to the TED database, I haven’t been able to run or test them — they may still require debugging. Attaching the scripts here in case they’re helpful; please let me know if anything needs to be adjusted for your use.

Happy to adjust anything if needed, and please feel free to reach out with any questions.
