Hi Denny, hope your day’s going well! I’m trying to get a better feel for how things really work across the desk and thought it’d be great to hear your perspective from the Sales side. It’d also be nice to have a proper chat since we’ve only had quick hellos so far. Would you be open to a quick 15–20 min chat sometime next week? I’m totally flexible on timing!
