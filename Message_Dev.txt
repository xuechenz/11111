Hi Dev,

Thank you so much for your kind words and for raising such a thoughtful and practical question.

You're absolutely right in pointing out the value of a two-stage architecture for real-world deployment. In our experience, the need for this setup often depends on how the model handles its input space. When trained with key market parameters (like interest rates and volatility) as part of the input, the model typically generalizes well enough that a second stage may not be necessary.

However, for solvers with fixed parameters, your suggested approach proves very effective. We’ve found that initializing the model with previous day’s weights enables quick fine-tuning, as market shifts tend to be incremental. For more significant changes, we maintain a pretrained library across a grid of parameters and fine-tune the closest match—striking a balance between accuracy and responsiveness for intraday updates.

It means a lot to receive your feedback — thank you for taking the time to engage with my presentation.

Best regards,
Annie
